UNIVERSALITY

Class Goal: creating a universe of possibilities rather than a polished finished project
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 --> you only have to remember nine things to make all the numbers
    0 --> this allowed for a RULE system/PLACEHOLDERS rather than just literal representation
    
What are the abstract components of story that can be put together like numerals?
    not the literal physical components, but the interior/emotional elements

Versions versus Copies

Universal Machine - a programmable machine (software)

The imagingation trascends time and space, as does cinematics:
    The power of The Cut -- we don't have to physically travel to the next thing, we move at the speed of thought
    How can VR give us even more than the cut as a cinematic tool?
    How can we experimentally evoke emotions?
    How are you rewarded visually with different cuts? 
    Vision is more predictive than reactive
    
    
ASSIGNMENT:
create a camera in three.js
use it to create a panorama
leave room in your setting to add in elements later on
you will be building new scenes each week within this setting

GPUs can be used in Machine Learning: http://www.nvidia.com/object/machine-learning.html

Hyper = above, upper level dimension
Hypertext allows multiple things to be next to the same thing at the same time
